Checkout [Redis](https://redis.io/), [redis-om](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node)

This is an example `NodeJS` application on how to use `redis-om` in the `CommonJS` approach. As I worked on a legacy NodeJS app written in CommonJS Syntax, I could not use the Module approach (like import, top-level await, etc.), so this is how I implemented redis-om in the legacy NodeJS app. Please let me know if there is anything that can be implemented better.

This example application is made with [redis-om-node-tutorial](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-om-node-tutorial) as a base.

### Disclaimer

This is not an official CommonJS solution for implementing `redis-om`. I implemented this as a workaround as there is no proper documentation for implementing the same.
